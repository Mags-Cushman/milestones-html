  <h1>Here's a header</h1>
  <p>Now I'm gonna write a little paragraph. I'm really enjoying HTML, it's fun and very satisfying, definitly the easiest coding language so far. Github is confusing but I'm figuring it out. I'm very excited that I also understand CSS a lot better but Javascript is scary. Here's the end of my paragraph, if you read this far, thank you.</p>
  <h2>My second header</h2>
  <p>Wow look at me go! Now we're moving quite well! I've got some nice HTML writing down and it's going beautifully. I've had a lot of coffee, I think it's funny how coffee and coding always go together. It's just better that way. I hope whoever is reading this is enjoying a nice cup of coffee.</p>
